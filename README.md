Complaint management system - Complaint management (CM) software helps record and collate complaints as customers and employees report them. CM software can be purchased as a standalone product, as a component module for existing software or as one of several applications in an integrated software suite.

what is complaint management?
Gone are the days when customer service reps were taking notes by hand or saving customers' complaints and questions in Microsoft Word. Businesses nowadays use automated complaint processing software to streamline customer service management and solve complex issues in a prompt, professional manner. These programs allow companies to provide consistent support across channels, from email and live chat to social media.

The primary goal of complaint management is to improve customer service. Companies across all sectors are now using automated software to address complaints related to financial services, online purchases, long waiting times and more. Some types of customer complaints, such as those encountered in hospitals and other medical facilities, can result in serious safety issues and need to be addressed immediately. Failure to do so can lead to hefty fines or even lawsuits.

In a broad sense, complaint management is the process by which companies handle customers' complaints. If managed effectively, complaints can help your business grow and improve its operations. You'll gain a better understanding of your clients, collect data and feedback, increase customer loyalty and strengthen your brand. This approach also allows you to identify recurring problems and address small issues before they escalate.

why use complaint management software
Several types of complaint management software programs exist, and each has distinctive features. Some are offered as part of customer relationship management systems, keeping all customer data in a centralized location. Freshdesk, for example, allows companies to easily track interactions with potential and existing clients. Users can manage support tickets, set deadlines for ticket response, convert emails into tickets and live chat with customers.

Another popular option for tracking customer complaints is Jira Service Desk. It features a user-friendly help center that your team can use to manage customer interactions, collect customer satisfaction feedback, assign tickets to the right departments and more. Depending on your industry and business needs, you may also try Bitrix24, Salesforce, Wix Answers and other software programs.

No matter how great your products, you can't please everyone. Customer complaints are a normal part of any business. Think of them as valuable insights about your audience and its needs. Use them to gather feedback on areas that need improvement and position yourself as a customer-centric organization.
